# Brise — Early Access Waitlist Page

This repository contains the early-access waitlist page for a crypto project.
It’s designed to collect emails for early access and let users share a unique referral link to move up the priority list.

## What This Page Does

- **Early access signup**: Users enter an email to request a spot.
- **Limited availability**: Built around a fixed-capacity waitlist (e.g., first 10,000 signups).
- **Referral link after signup**: After successful registration, the page provides a unique shareable link.
- **Referral tracking**: If someone joins using a referral link, the referrer gets credited.

## User Experience (Flow)

1. User lands on the early access page.
2. User submits their email to join the waitlist.
3. On success, the page shows a unique referral link.
4. User shares the link to invite others and improve their priority.

## Notes

This is a focused waitlist/early-access experience intended for a crypto product launch.
The emphasis is on a clean landing experience, fast signup, and referral-driven growth.
